        <h1>1880-1895: the birth of Lithographic poster</h1>

             <p> 
            The evolution and development of poster art has always been closely<br> 
            linked to technical advances in printmaking, notably lithography.<br>  
            Lithography was invented by Alois Senefelder (1771-1834) as far back<br>  
            as 1798, but for decades it was too slow and expensive for poster<br>  
            production. Most posterscontinued to be simple wood or metal engravings<br>  
            with little colour or design - they were used to convey only the most<br>  
            important information from the government, as well as occasional advertising<br> 
            with hierarchal typography. The 19th century witnessed the advent of<br>  
            chromolithography though, but it had little to non-impact on the overall<br>  
            poster design yet. This all changed around 1880 with the invention of<br>  
            Jules Cheret 's so-called „3 stone lithographic process" - a breakthrough<br>  
            which allowed lithographers to produce a wide spectrum of colours from just<br>  
            three stones - usually using primary colours of red, yellow and blue. In<br>  
            that sense, low-cost colour posters at last became a reality, and many artists<br>  
            began to experiment, despite having strong and powerful backgrounds in fine<br>  
            art or painting.

            <p>
            Cheret's process nevertheless still demanded superb artistry and craftsmanship.<br> 
             The result was worthwhile - a remarkable intensity of colour and texture,<br>  
             with sublime transparencies and nuances impossible in other media (even to this day).<br>  
             The ability to combine word and image in such an attractive and economical format<br> 
             finally allowed the lithographic poster to usher in the modern age of advertising.<br>  
             If the poster was absent from the history, the probability of graphic design not<br>  
             existing would be a reality.  Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge an<br>  
             important figure in history, who has opened many doors in terms of better<br> 
             printing for the young artists to cling to.<br>

            Known as the "father of the fine art poster", Jules Cheret not only developed<br>
            a cheaper colour lithographic process, with richer more expressive colours, but<br>
            he has also enhanced the aesthetic nature of the poster, endowed it with graceful<br>
            designs (some influenced by Ukiyo-e woodblock prints from Japan), and transformed<br>
            it into an independent work of art. Furthermore, he encouraged other painters<br> 
            to explore the genre, because of the skill most painters had. He also introduced<br> 
            the feminine form into his designs, for extra viewer-appeal. His female subjects<br> 
            became so popular that Parisians dubbed them Cherettes. In total, Cheret produced<br> 
            more than 1,000 posters, beginning with his 1867 advertisement for Sarah Bernardt's<br>
             performance as Princess Desiree in the comedy La Biche au Bois. Cheret's work<br> 
            is celebrated throughout the world, and, by being honoured in 1928 with the opening<br> 
            of the Cheret Museum in Nice, Jules Cheret's posters, are some of the most highly<br> 
            sought-after items from the late 19th century.
