            face of Paris, and the city becomes somewhat of a public gallery<br>
            to the audiences. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Alphonse Mucha's<br>
            works are the prime geniuses of the eras, which allows for the<br>

            so does the poster go in a mass production period. Here, one can notice<br>

             The poster craze of the 1950s divides poster design into two categories - <br>
             more eclectic and eccentric 50s Style, and symmetrical, logical<br>

            When comparing 1950s and 1960s, one might notice a huge gap of <br>
            difference in how chaotic the 60s were. Revoliunary ideas, the <br>

             were finally able to explore the depths of their creativity without <br>
             the need to follow any norms or guides. Early Eighties gives us a <br>
